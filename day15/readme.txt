The Day 15 problem appears to be a Linear Programming problem.  From my research, PuLP is a popular Linear Programming package for Python.  I will try it out.

After spending some time with this problem, the Day 15 problem cannot be handled with PuLP, since the objective function multiplies the decision variables together.  Another approach will be taken, instead.
