adventOfCode 2015 day 20, part B
https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/20

Below are my notes for thinking through part B:

Elf 1 goes to 1,2,3,...,50
Elf 2 goes to 2,4,6,...,100
Elf 3 goes to 3,6,9,...,150

THESE ARE THE SAME AS part A:
House 1 is visited by elf 1
House 2 is visited by elves 1,2
House 3 is visited by elves 1,3
All houses 1 - 50 have the same elf visits as A.

Differences
House 51 and all higher numbers aren't visited by elf 1
House 102 (and all higher numbers with % 2 == 0) aren't visited by elf 2
House 153 (and all higher numbers with % 3 == 0) aren't visited by elf 3

The changeover occurs at house_number / 50
